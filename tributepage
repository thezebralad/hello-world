 <ul>
   <li> Influenced themselves by Dinosaur Jr, Swerverdriver and Superchunk, they play a style of emo/indie rock that heavily influenced countless bands including Jimmy Eat World and New Found Glory.</li>
   <li> Released their first 7' EP "Gloria" in 1994 and followed that with "February/M.D" in 1996.</li>
  <li> Then released "The Power of Failing" album in January 1997, which was recorded at Music Lane Studios in Austin during 1996.</li>
  <li> They also released a split EP with Jimmy Eat World and Sensfield in 1997 which contained the song "Crazy."</li>
  <li> The band actually broke up after recording their second and final album "EndSerenading" which was released in August 1998.</li>
  <li> The members went on to form other bands such as The Gloria Record and Imbroco, whilst Chris Simpson released solo work under the name Zookeeper.</li>
  <li> In 2014, the band announced they were getting back together for a short run of shows in the USA. They then decided to do a European tour (their first ever) in 2015 along with shows in Japan and Australia.</li>
  <li> I was lucky enough to see Mineral play live in Manchester, UK on 12th February 2015, which they played my favourite song, ironically called "February!"</li>
  <li> As of today, the band are still active but have no plans to release new music. The UK based label Xtra Mile Recordings re-released both albums on 12' vinyl and the band themselves are planning "something" for their 25th anniversary.</li>
